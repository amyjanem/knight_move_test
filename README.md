#<u>Find My Number<u>

Given the following keyboard, find all 10 key sequences that can be keyed in given the following constraints:
1. The initial keypress can be any key.
2. Each subsequent keypress must be a knight move from the previous key. (Knight move explained below)
3. There can be at most 2 vowels in the sequence.

(Note: Given these constraints, a key can be pressed multiple times in the same sequence)

A knight move is defined as either of the following:
1. Move two keys vertically and one horizontally.
2. Move two keys horizontally and one vertically. 

(Note: No wrapping allowed on a knight move)

The program should print the number of valid 10 key sequences on a single line to standard out.
